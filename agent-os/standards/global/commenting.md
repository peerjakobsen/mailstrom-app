## Code commenting in Dart

- **Self-Documenting Code**: Write code that explains itself through clear structure and naming
- **Minimal, Helpful Comments**: Add concise comments to explain complex business logic or non-obvious decisions
- **Doc Comments for Public API**: Use `///` doc comments on public classes, methods, and properties
- **Don't Comment Changes or Fixes**: Do not leave comments about recent or temporary changes; comments should be evergreen
- **TODO Format**: Use `// TODO:` for planned improvements; include context about what needs to be done
