# Product Mission

## One-Liner

Bulk-clean your Gmail inbox by sender — see who's flooding you, unsubscribe, and delete in one click.

## Problem

People accumulate thousands of emails over time -- newsletters they never read, automated notifications, marketing blasts, and transactional receipts. Manually cleaning up an inbox is tedious and impractical at scale. Existing email clients offer no efficient way to bulk-clean by sender across an entire mailbox.

## Target Users

Anyone overwhelmed by email clutter who wants to reclaim their inbox without manually processing emails one by one. Primarily Gmail users with large, accumulated mailboxes.

## Solution

Mailstrom is a desktop-native Gmail cleanup tool that connects via OAuth, analyzes the entire mailbox, and groups emails by sender in an intuitive tree view. Users can see exactly who sends them the most email, bulk-select senders, and unsubscribe + delete in a single workflow. The key differentiator is the sender-centric tree view that makes it immediately clear where inbox bloat comes from, combined with one-click bulk actions to clean it up.
